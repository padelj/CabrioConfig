CabrioConfig
============

Mono compliant C# project for editing and updating the Cabrio-FE for emulators config.xml.

Requires that you have created the mameinfo.xml file from the command
  
  mame -listxml >mameinfo.xml
  
  
I need some help with Gtk NodeView using Stetic. Any help would be appreciated.
